# Export Unlimited Records into CSV

## Introduction

This package will help you in exporting unlimited data using laravel's eloquent query and json resource. It is based on queue batching of laravel. It supports all databases eloquent supports. 

## Installation

Install **BulkExportCSV**:

```bash
composer require akki/bulkexportcsv
```

Publish the config file(config/bulkexportcsv.php), model (BulkExportCSV.php) and migration(bulk_export_csv table):

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Akshay\BulkExportCSV\ServiceProvider"
```

Prepare Migration of queue tables:

```bash
php artisan queue:table
php artisan queue:batches-table
```

Miragte tables:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Usage

### Make a query
```php
$query = \App\Models\User::query();
$query->with('serviceProvider')->where('country', 'IN');
```

### Make a JSON resource
```php
php artisan make:resource UserResource
UserResource.php:
public function toArray($request)
{
    return [
        'Name' => $this->name,
        'Email' => $this->email,
        'Service Provider' => $this->serviceProvider->org_name,
        'Contact Number' => $this->contact_number,
    ];
}
```

### Export into CSV
```php
use BulkExportCSV;

$query = \App\Models\User::query();
$query->with('serviceProvider')->where('country', 'IN');

$resource_namespace = 'App\Http\Resources\UserResource';

$bulkExportCSV = BulkExportCSV::build($query, $resource_namespace);
```

### Unserialize
```php
$builder = \EloquentSerialize::unserialize($package);

foreach ($builder->get() as $item) {
    // ...
}
```

### Modify the bootstrap flow

We need to enable both **Laravel Passport** provider and **Lumen Passport** specific provider:

```php
/** @file bootstrap/app.php */

// Enable Facades
$app->withFacades();

// Enable Eloquent
$app->withEloquent();

// Enable auth middleware (shipped with Lumen)
$app->routeMiddleware([
    'auth' => App\Http\Middleware\Authenticate::class,
]);

// Register two service providers, Laravel Passport and Lumen adapter
$app->register(Laravel\Passport\PassportServiceProvider::class);
$app->register(Dusterio\LumenPassport\PassportServiceProvider::class);
```

### Laravel Passport ^7.3.2 and newer

On 30 Jul 2019 [Laravel Passport 7.3.2](https://github.com/laravel/passport/releases/tag/v7.3.2) had a breaking change - new method introduced on Application class that exists in Laravel but not in Lumen. You could either lock in to an older version or swap the Application class like follows:

```php
/** @file bootstrap/app.php */

//$app = new Laravel\Lumen\Application(
//    dirname(__DIR__)
//);
$app = new \Dusterio\LumenPassport\Lumen7Application(
    dirname(__DIR__)
);
```

\* _Note: If you look inside this class - all it does is adding an extra method `configurationIsCached()` that always returns `false`._

### Migrate and install Laravel Passport

```bash
# Create new tables for Passport
php artisan migrate

# Install encryption keys and other stuff for Passport
php artisan passport:install
```

It will output the Personal access client ID and secret, and the Password grand client ID and secret.

\* _Note: Save the secrets in a safe place, you'll need them later to request the access tokens._

## Configuration

### Configure Authentication

Edit `config/auth.php` to suit your needs. A simple example:

```php
/** @file config/auth.php */

return [

    'providers' => [
        'users' => [
            'driver' => 'eloquent',
            'model' => \App\Models\User::class
        ]
    ],

];
```

\* _Note: Lumen 7.x and older uses `\App\User::class`_

Load the config since Lumen doesn't load config files automatically:

```php
/** @file bootstrap/app.php */

$app->configure('auth');
```

### Registering Routes

Next, you should call the `LumenPassport::routes` method within the `boot` method of your application (one of your service providers). This method will register the routes necessary to issue access tokens and revoke access tokens, clients, and personal access tokens:

```php
/** @file app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php */

use Dusterio\LumenPassport\LumenPassport;

class AuthServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        LumenPassport::routes($this->app);

        /* rest of boot */
    }
}
```

### User model

Make sure your user model uses **Laravel Passport**'s `HasApiTokens` trait.

```php
/** @file app/Models/User.php */

use Laravel\Passport\HasApiTokens;

class User extends Model implements AuthenticatableContract, AuthorizableContract
{
    use HasApiTokens, Authenticatable, Authorizable, HasFactory;

    /* rest of the model */
}
```

## Usage

You'll find all the documentation in [Laravel Passport Docs](https://laravel.com/docs/master/passport).

### Curl example with username and password authentication

First you have to [issue an access token](https://laravel.com/docs/master/passport#issuing-access-tokens) and then you can use it to authenticate your requests.

```bash
# Request
curl --location --request POST '{{APP_URL}}/oauth/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "grant_type": "password",
    "client_id": "{{CLIENT_ID}}",
    "client_secret": "{{CLIENT_SECRET}}",
    "username": "{{USER_EMAIL}}",
    "password": "{{USER_PASSWORD}}",
    "scope": "*"
}'
```

```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 31536000,
    "access_token": "******",
    "refresh_token": "******"
}
```

And with the `access_token` you can request access to the routes that uses the Auth:Api Middleware provided by the **Lumen Passport**.

```php
/** @file routes/web.php */

$router->get('/ping', ['middleware' => 'auth', fn () => 'pong']);
```

```bash
# Request
curl --location --request GET '{{APP_URL}}/ping' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}'
```

```html
pong
```

### Installed routes

This package mounts the following routes after you call `routes()` method, all of them belongs to the namespace `\Laravel\Passport\Http\Controllers`:

Verb | Path | Controller | Action | Middleware
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
POST   | /oauth/token                             | AccessTokenController           | issueToken | -
GET    | /oauth/tokens                            | AuthorizedAccessTokenController | forUser    | auth
DELETE | /oauth/tokens/{token_id}                 | AuthorizedAccessTokenController | destroy    | auth
POST   | /oauth/token/refresh                     | TransientTokenController        | refresh    | auth
GET    | /oauth/clients                           | ClientController                | forUser    | auth
POST   | /oauth/clients                           | ClientController                | store      | auth
PUT    | /oauth/clients/{client_id}               | ClientController                | update     | auth
DELETE | /oauth/clients/{client_id}               | ClientController                | destroy    | auth
GET    | /oauth/scopes                            | ScopeController                 | all        | auth
GET    | /oauth/personal-access-tokens            | PersonalAccessTokenController   | forUser    | auth
POST   | /oauth/personal-access-tokens            | PersonalAccessTokenController   | store      | auth
DELETE | /oauth/personal-access-tokens/{token_id} | PersonalAccessTokenController   | destroy    | auth

\* _Note: some of the **Laravel Passport**'s routes had to 'go away' because they are web-related and rely on sessions (eg. authorise pages). Lumen is an API framework so only API-related routes are present._

## Extra features

There are a couple of extra features that aren't present in **Laravel Passport**

### Prefixing Routes

You can add that into an existing group, or add use this route registrar independently like so;

```php
/** @file app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php */

use Dusterio\LumenPassport\LumenPassport;

class AuthServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        LumenPassport::routes($this->app, ['prefix' => 'v1/oauth']);

        /* rest of boot */
    }
}
```

### Multiple tokens per client

Sometimes it's handy to allow multiple access tokens per password grant client. Eg. user logs in from several browsers
simultaneously. Currently **Laravel Passport** does not allow that.

```php
/** @file app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php */

use Dusterio\LumenPassport\LumenPassport;

class AuthServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        LumenPassport::routes($this->app);
        LumenPassport::allowMultipleTokens();

        /* rest of boot */
    }
}
```

### Different TTLs for different password clients

**Laravel Passport** allows to set one global TTL (time to live) for access tokens, but it may be useful sometimes to set different TTLs for different clients (eg. mobile users get more time than desktop users).

Simply do the following in your service provider:

```php
/** @file app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php */

use Carbon\Carbon;
use Dusterio\LumenPassport\LumenPassport;

class AuthServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot()
    {
        LumenPassport::routes($this->app);
        $client_id = '1';
        LumenPassport::tokensExpireIn(Carbon::now()->addDays(14), $client_id); 

        /* rest of boot */
    }
}
```

If you don't specify client Id, it will simply fall back to Laravel Passport implementation.

### Purge expired tokens

```bash
php artisan passport:purge
```

Simply run it to remove expired refresh tokens and their corresponding access tokens from the database.
